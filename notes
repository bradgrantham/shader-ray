Better cache behavior
    Try group data into the same texture for caching, measure performance
        15 values - 4 vec4s?
    Try triangle data into the same texture for caching, measure performance
        9 values - 3 vec3s?
    textures are probably cached by 8x8 or 16x16 or other pow2 regions
        So try to store them as pow2 so they don't cross a boundary?
        But GPUs are getting better at compute storing and reading from buffers
Make named constants (e.g. BVH stats array)
chrono
more C++ish pointer operations
verify ray differentials
PBR
hierarchical objects
fly
gltf 2.0
